The R script processes and analyzes Brooklyn real estate data from 2016 to 2020. It begins by loading and cleaning data from multiple CSV files, ensuring consistent formatting and removing unwanted characters. The script filters the dataset to include only single-unit residential properties with valid square footage and sale prices within a specific range. Additional features, such as logarithmic transformations, squared and interaction terms, and property age, are created for enhanced modeling. Neighborhoods are grouped into clusters, and aggregated metrics, like average sale prices by neighborhood and zip code, are calculated. Several linear regression models are developed to predict sale prices, incorporating polynomial terms and interaction effects. The modelsâ€™ predictions are back-transformed to evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE.
